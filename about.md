<p>Yoonsik Jung is a Direct Ph.D Student in Industrial and Management Engineering, Korea University. His research interests are Mathematical Optimization, Operations Research, Smart Manufacturig, and Machine Learning.</p>

<h3> Research Interests </h3>
<b> Mathematical Optimization & Operations Research</b>
<p> Using mathematical modeling and (meta-)heuristics, he designed a scheduling algorithm to minimize the ratio of work in process on the battery formation facility. </p>

<b> Smart Manufacturing & Machine Learning </b>
<p> He predicted a wearing of machining tools, especially applying deep learning methods and signal decomposition processes such as Fourier transform and wavelet transform. He also developed the interpretable machine learning model to predict churn of MMORPG(Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) users. Furthermore, he proposed the integer programming based promotion strategy to improve retention of action role playing game 'Blade and Soul' from NCSOFT . </p>
