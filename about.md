<p>
  Yoonsik Jung is a Ph.D. candidate in Industrial and Management Engineering at Korea University. His research interests include mathematical optimization, operations research, smart manufacturing, and machine learning.
</p>

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<b>Mathematical Optimization &amp; Operations Research</b>
<p>
  Leveraging mathematical modeling and meta-heuristic techniques, he has designed a scheduling algorithm aimed at minimizing the work‐in‐process ratio at battery formation facilities [C4][C7].
</p>

<b>Smart Manufacturing &amp; Machine Learning</b>
<p>
  He has applied deep learning methods along with signal decomposition techniques, such as Fourier and wavelet transforms, to predict tool wear in machining processes [C6][C8]. Additionally, he developed an interpretable machine learning model to predict churn among MMORPG users. Furthermore, he proposed an integer programming–based promotion strategy to enhance user retention for NCSOFT’s action role-playing game, <i>Blade and Soul</i> [Award 2].
